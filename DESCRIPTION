Description: GenoTypeR is a comprehensive tool designed for managing and 
    analyzing genetic data. It includes a robust framework with data structures 
    for various gene types. The package introduces a suite of S4 classes that 
    represent various gene categories, including protein-coding genes, 
    long non-coding RNA genes, microRNA genes and many more, ensuring versatily 
    accross genomic studies. GenoTypeR also includes specific functions 
    such as 'lengthProduct' which returns the length of the product 
    of a specific gene object.
